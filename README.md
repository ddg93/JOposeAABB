# Welcome to the JOposeAABB repository 
Deep Learning model for the pose estimation of axisymmetrical objects.
The model estimates the particle orientation vector from the three-dimensional Axes-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) of the oriented axisymmetrical particle.
This methodology is applied to reconstruct the Jeffery Orbits (JO) of cylinders and ellipsoids suspended in a viscous shear flow using two perpendicular cameras.

Run the AABB_poseEstimation.ipynb on Google Colab for a quick demonstration.
