# JOposeAABB
Deep Learning model for the pose estimation of axisymmetrical particles suspended in a viscous shear flow from their Axis-Aligned Bounding Box.
The model is trained on synthetic data calculated from the particle geometry: in this example we consider a prolate cylinder with aspect ratio r=9.01.
